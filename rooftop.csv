Fall at Yellowstone,http://images.nationalgeographic.com/wpf/media-live/photos/000/207/cache/yellowstone-bison-national-park_20729_600x450.jpg,"Yellow Stone, Wyoming",http://www.nps.gov/yell/index.htm,"Visit Yellowstone near the end of its fall season (between labour Day and 5th November), and you will see the beautiful snow capped evergreens in the morning, view the different scenic locations with clear skies, and still hike in moderate temperatures. 

Go too soon, and you will be caught among hordes of tourists, and too late, the freezing cold and dangerous driving conditions will cut short your evenings. Yellowstone can be an overwhelming experience, so plan accordingly with respect to time, and understand that the random close encounters along the roads and trails will be your memorable moments. 

Always respect the wilderness, the wildlife, and take your time to explore and be in awe of the wonders of Yellowstone. While there are occasions where basic photography is adequate to document the ephemeral beauty that you see, Yellowstone is not one of them. Bring your best camera, eye, paints and sketchbooks, proper clothing, and you will be glad afterwards."
