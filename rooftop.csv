Get Tropical at 230 Fifth,http://www.coolturehunter.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/230-Fifth-new-york.jpg,"230 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY",http://www.230-fifth.com/index.php,"The 230 Fifth boasts both palm trees and the New York skyline, offering breath taking views while you sip on your favorite tropical cocktail. 

Open all year, it's worth avoiding at peak times (Summer evenings) because the place gets packed.  "

The crowd is upscale but not pretentious.

The setting has a high ceiling and is spacious (plenty of room to dance). Very helpful staff regarding drink suggestions. During happy hour the drinks are two for one! can't argue with that!"

With a great menu, pleasant staff, and huge wine selection what more can you ask for?

If you want a seat get there early on the weekends as they tend to be a very popular local attraction."
Birreria High Atop Eatily,http://lauragrai.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/eataly1.jpg,"200 5th Ave, New York, NY 10010",http://www.eataly.com/birreria/,"Come to Birreria for the food -- and the amazing selection of locally brewed craft beer at this rooftop bar. 

Get up there through 5th Ave's greatest deli, Eatily. The entrance is near to Eatily's exit, behind the beers and cook books - ask if you can't find it. 

Enjoy the year-round laid back and weather proof atmosphere and cozy New York skyline views. 

Make sure you try the brussel sprouts and the smashed new potatoe sides - all of the main meals we've tried have been delicious. "
