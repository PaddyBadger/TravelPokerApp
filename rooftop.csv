Large windows provide a view of New York's beautiful city streets, bartenders provide banter, and lack of cleaning adds to the dive bar feel. Fun, and not fussy - which is relatively unusual for a bar in NYC."

Long known as ""the battery"", the southern Manhattan shore eventually became a posh land of skyscrapers and beautiful homes for the wealthy. 

It's only natural that a park would eventually be built. These 25 urban acres are a respite from the bustle of the city, and a must-see for any tourist finding themselves below 14th St."
Stuff your face at Smorgasburg,http://www.smorgasburg.com/wp-content/uploads/smorg1.jpg,"80 North 5th Street, Williamsburg",http://www.smorgasburg.com/,"Every weekend, Williamsburg hosts the Smorgasburg, where many of New York and Brooklyn's finest food trucks convene to provide an extremely difficult dilemma: what on earth do I want to eat? 

Seriously the choice is mind boggling, go hungry, and take your time. You can have Dim Sum, curry, burgers, Lobster Rolls, wings, Mexican, BBQ, Lebanese and more.  

Go in the Summer, and enjoy the event outside on a Sunday, or in the Winter, when the Brooklyn Flea and Smorgasburg mesh inside the 80 North 5th St. in Williamsburg. "
Longboat to Lembongen,"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RS8SXfOlrMQ/Uk6k4ZhSxQI/AAAAAAAACvA/y86SGQAtL6w/s1600/Local%2Bboat,%2BBali%2B-%2BAAS%2BArchives.jpg","Sanur Beach, Bali, Indonesia",http://wikitravel.org/en/Nusa_Lembongan,"Your only real option for getting to Nusa Lembongen, which is well worth a visit if you have time, is getting a boat, and getting your feet wet. Not recommended in rough seas, the journey is a thrilling hour with the sea and wind, and sun, in your hair, in a stunning setting. 

Head north from Kuta to Sanur Beach, prepare to haggle over the price of the boat (a bit) - the cheapest ""tourist"" option (for reasons of safety and comfort) should be around Rp 100,000 ($9), though prices change all the time, so don't be alarmed if they insist on more. 

Wade into the water to get onto the boat, with your bag above your head, and be prepared for some amazing views of Bali and Lembongen.

Not for the super safety conscious! "
Make Hoa’s Your Home,https://scontent-b-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/t1/933912_10201078595421532_620341829_n.jpg,"China Beach, Vietnam",https://www.facebook.com/groups/5336437806/,"Something of a Backpacker's Mecca on China Beach, Da Nang, Hoa's is one of the longest standing hostels in the area. If you're backpacking in Vietnam, and you want to check out the miles and miles of amazing beach, you can't stay anywhere else. 

There has been a concentrated period of development in the area since we visited in 2005 and 2007, with large resorts springing up in the area, and Hoa has had to move his hostel to a new location just down the road from his old place, but if you're looking for a genuine backpacking experience, to meet other travellers, and to just CHILL THE HELL OUT, Hoa's is your place. 

Every evening, Hoa and his family cook a super cheap, optional dinner for travellers, including the best spring rolls you will ever taste, and usualy a good amount of fish. Everything is done on a trust basis at Hoa's - you help yourself to a beer from the fridge, note it down in the book, and pay up when you want (usually when you leave). A night's stay is under $10, and the beach is, quite simply, amazing. 

We'd recommend heading up to Hoi Anne when you've had enough of this beach - you can have anything you can imagine tailor made there!"
