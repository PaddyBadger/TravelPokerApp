Lark like Lara at Angkor Wat,http://www.argo-platinum.com/sites/default/files/cities/photos/angkor-wat-04.jpg,"Angkor Wat, Cambodia",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Wat,"Build in the 12th Century, Angkor Wat is the World's largest religious site. Covering over 400Km2, ANgkor itself is considered a city, though you don't need to cover that much ground to see many of the spectacular sites on offer. 

Angkor Wat Temple is the most famous of the temples, and the only one that is still in use. With it's 3 levels and huge surrounding moat, it's amazing to see in person, especially at sunset. 

Angkor is best navigated bike, and if you're staying in nearby Siam Reap, the 5km journey is also pretty cool, though perhaps not the best option if it's very hot. 

Be prepared to attract some attention from the locals as a visitor - the main source of income in the area is from tourists, so everyone is working for tips. "
Gawp at the Worldâ€™s Biggest,http://www.hdwallpapers.in/walls/burj_khalifa_the_dubai_fountain-HD.jpg,"Dubai Mall, UAE",http://www.burjkhalifa.ae/en/,"The World's (current) tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, is the crowning jewl of the spectacular Dubai skyline, and well worth a visit if you're in Dubai. But it's not the only record breaker in the world's biggest Mall (by area) Dubal Mall (where you get to the Burj). 

You'l also see the world's largest indoor aquarium, and if you're there in the afternoon, the fountains outside the Burj, which while they might not break any records, are still lovely. If you're hungry, grab a seat outside (if it's not too hot) at one of the many restaurants, and enjoy a few shows.

Like most things in Dubai, you'll have to get a taxi or drive to get to the complex, but the 1000+ shops, aquarium and the Burj will take some time. 

Book tickets for the Burj in advance, as the price is 25% less that it would be in person, and if you want to couple the trip to the top with a drink, the Skybar is worth a visit and is only 1 level below the observation deck (also book).

Remember 9/11 at Ground Zero,http://cglearn.it/TwinTowers/buildnew_big.jpg,"Ground Zero, Manhattan",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_September_11_Memorial_%26_Museum,"A visit to the 16 acre site that pays tribute to the events of 9/11 is a must for any New York visit. Book in advance beore you go to skip the que, and be prepared for an extremly emotional experience.
