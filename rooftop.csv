Gaze at the Guggenheim Collection,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Guggenheim_museum_esterno.JPG,"1071 5th Avenue, New York, NY",http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york,"When visiting the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum you get to view art in art. One of the most enticing parts of the Guggenheim museum is the building in which the private collections of art from the 19th century to present are housed, which is now considered just as much a piece of artwork as the art itself. 

From the world's largest collection of Kandinskys to private collections of Manet, Monet and Picasso you can find yourself following the spiral of the building up and up, lost in the art for hours on end, just as Franklin Lloyd Wright intended. 

Be sure not to miss the special exhibits, download the app, and give yourself plenty of time to be swept away by some of the most important works of art from the Impressionist time all the way to Modern art."

It is the heart of the city that never sleeps, where billboards light up the busy intersections long after the Broadway shows have closed for the night. 

Tourists clamor to take pictures with the people dressed as the statue of liberty, or whichever superhero is popular, while various companys offer people the chance to tweet in photos of themselves to display on the screens surrounded by posters of Broadway Stars. 

Visit in the evening when it's dark - the lights are all the more impressive when they aren't competing with the sun. 

And if you're really daring, visit Times Square for the New Year's Eve celebration, where you will stand for hours in the cold, shoulder-to-shoulder with complete strangers waiting for the most famous ball in the world to drop for a once in a lifetime experience."
